AES defines\n * its own methods of addition and multiplication but keeps some important\n * properties the same, ie: associativity and distributivity. The\n * explanation below tries to shed some light on how AES defines addition\n * and multiplication of bytes and 32-bit words in order to perform its\n * encryption and decryption algorithms.\n *\n * The basics:\n *\n * The AES algorithm views bytes as binary representations of polynomials\n * that have either 1 or 0 as the coefficients. It defines the addition\n * or subtraction of two bytes as the XOR operation. It also defines the\n * multiplication of two bytes as a finite field referred to as GF(2^8)\n * (Note: 'GF' means \"Galois Field\" which is a field that contains a finite\n * number of elements so GF(2^8) has 256 elements).\n *\n * This means that any two bytes can be represented as binary polynomials;\n * when they multiplied together and modularly reduced by an irreducible\n * polynomial of the 8th degree, the results are the field GF(2^8). The\n * specific irreducible polynomial that AES uses in hexadecimal is 0x11b.\n * This multiplication is associative with 0x01 as the identity:\n *\n * (b * 0x01 = GF(b, 0x01) = b).\n *\n * The operation GF(b, 0x02) can be performed at the byte level by left\n * shifting b once and then XOR'ing it (to perform the modular reduction)\n * with 0x11b if b is >= 128. Repeated application of the multiplication\n * of 0x02 can be used to implement the multiplication of any two bytes.\n *\n * For instance, multiplying 0x57 and 0x13, denoted as GF(0x57, 0x13), can\n * be performed by factoring 0x13 into 0x01, 0x02, and 0x10. Then these\n * factors can each be multiplied by 0x57 and then added together. To do\n * the multiplication, values for 0x57 multiplied by each of these 3 factors\n * can be precomputed and stored in a table. To add them, the values from\n * the table are XOR'd together.\n *\n * AES also defines addition and multiplication of words, that is 4-byte\n * numbers represented as polynomials of 3 degrees where the coefficients\n * are the values of the bytes.\n *\n * The word [a0, a1, a2, a3] is a polynomial a3x^3 + a2x^2 + a1x + a0.\n *\n * Addition is performed by XOR'ing like powers of x. Multiplication\n * is performed in two steps, the first is an algebriac expansion as\n * you would do normally (where addition is XOR). But the result is\n * a polynomial larger than 3 degrees and thus it cannot fit in a word. So\n * next the result is modularly reduced by an AES-specific polynomial of\n * degree 4 which will always produce a polynomial of less than 4 degrees\n * such that it will fit in a word. In AES, this polynomial is x^4 + 1.\n *\n * The modular product of two polynomials 'a' and 'b' is thus:\n *\n * d(x) = d3x^3 + d2x^2 + d1x + d0\n * with\n * d0 = GF(a0, b0) ^ GF(a3, b1) ^ GF(a2, b2) ^ GF(a1, b3)\n * d1 = GF(a1, b0) ^ GF(a0, b1) ^ GF(a3, b2) ^ GF(a2, b3)\n * d2 = GF(a2, b0) ^ GF(a1, b1) ^ GF(a0, b2) ^ GF(a3, b3)\n * d3 = GF(a3, b0) ^ GF(a2, b1) ^ GF(a1, b2) ^ GF(a0, b3)\n *\n * As a matrix:\n *\n * [d0] = [a0 a3 a2 a1][b0]\n * [d1]   [a1 a0 a3 a2][b1]\n * [d2]   [a2 a1 a0 a3][b2]\n * [d3]   [a3 a2 a1 a0][b3]\n *\n * Special polynomials defined by AES (0x02 == {02}):\n * a(x)    = {03}x^3 + {01}x^2 + {01}x + {02}\n * a^-1(x) = {0b}x^3 + {0d}x^2 + {09}x + {0e}.\n *\n * These polynomials are used in the MixColumns() and InverseMixColumns()\n * operations, respectively, to cause each element in the state to affect\n * the output (referred to as diffusing).\n *\n * RotWord() uses: a0 = a1 = a2 = {00} and a3 = {01}, which is the\n * polynomial x3.\n *\n * The ShiftRows() method modifies the last 3 rows in the state (where\n * the state is 4 words with 4 bytes per word) by shifting bytes cyclically.\n * The 1st byte in the second row is moved to the end of the row. The 1st\n * and 2nd bytes in the third row are moved to the end of the row. The 1st,\n * 2nd, and 3rd bytes are moved in the fourth row.\n *\n * More details on how AES arithmetic works:\n *\n * In the polynomial representation of binary numbers, XOR performs addition\n * and subtraction and multiplication in GF(2^8) denoted as GF(a, b)\n * corresponds with the multiplication of polynomials modulo an irreducible\n * polynomial of degree 8. In other words, for AES, GF(a, b) will multiply\n * polynomial 'a' with polynomial 'b' and then do a modular reduction by\n * an AES-specific irreducible polynomial of degree 8.\n *\n * A polynomial is irreducible if its only divisors are one and itself. For\n * the AES algorithm, this irreducible polynomial is:\n *\n * m(x) = x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1,\n *\n * or {01}{1b} in hexadecimal notation, where each coefficient is a bit:\n * 100011011 = 283 = 0x11b.\n *\n * For example, GF(0x57, 0x83) = 0xc1 because\n *\n * 0x57 = 87  = 01010111 = x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1\n * 0x85 = 131 = 10000101 = x^7 + x + 1\n *\n * (x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1) * (x^7 + x + 1)\n * =  x^13 + x^11 + x^9 + x^8 + x^7 +\n *    x^7 + x^5 + x^3 + x^2 + x +\n *    x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1\n * =  x^13 + x^11 + x^9 + x^8 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + 1 = y\n *    y modulo (x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1)\n * =  x^7 + x^6 + 1.\n *\n * The modular reduction by m(x) guarantees the result will be a binary\n * polynomial of less than degree 8, so that it can fit in a byte.\n *\n * The operation to multiply a binary polynomial b with x (the polynomial\n * x in binary representation is 00000010) is:\n *\n * b_7x^8 + b_6x^7 + b_5x^6 + b_4x^5 + b_3x^4 + b_2x^3 + b_1x^2 + b_0x^1\n *\n * To get GF(b, x) we must reduce that by m(x). If b_7 is 0 (that is the\n * most significant bit is 0 in b) then the result is already reduced. If\n * it is 1, then we can reduce it by subtracting m(x) via an XOR.\n *\n * It follows that multiplication by x (00000010 or 0x02) can be implemented\n * by performing a left shift followed by a conditional bitwise XOR with\n * 0x1b. This operation on bytes is denoted by xtime(). Multiplication by\n * higher powers of x can be implemented by repeated application of xtime().\n *\n * By adding intermediate results, multiplication by any constant can be\n * implemented. For instance:\n *\n * GF(0x57, 0x13) = 0xfe because:\n *\n * xtime(b) = (b & 128) ? (b << 1 ^ 0x11b) : (b << 1)\n *\n * Note: We XOR with 0x11b instead of 0x1b because in javascript our\n * datatype for b can be larger than 1 byte, so a left shift will not\n * automatically eliminate bits that overflow a byte ... by XOR'ing the\n * overflow bit with 1 (the extra one from 0x11b) we zero it out.\n *\n * GF(0x57, 0x02) = xtime(0x57) = 0xae\n * GF(0x57, 0x04) = xtime(0xae) = 0x47\n * GF(0x57, 0x08) = xtime(0x47) = 0x8e\n * GF(0x57, 0x10) = xtime(0x8e) = 0x07\n *\n * GF(0x57, 0x13) = GF(0x57, (0x01 ^ 0x02 ^ 0x10))\n *\n * And by the distributive property (since XOR is addition and GF() is\n * multiplication):\n *\n * = GF(0x57, 0x01) ^ GF(0x57, 0x02) ^ GF(0x57, 0x10)\n * = 0x57 ^ 0xae ^ 0x07\n * = 0xfe.\n */\nfunction initialize() {\n  init = true;\n\n  /* Populate the Rcon table.

There are many\n      generators (128 out of 256): 3,5,6,9,11,82 to name a few. To fully\n      traverse GF we iterate 255 times, multiplying by our generator\n      each time.\n\n      On each iteration we can determine the multiplicative inverse for\n      the current element.\n\n      Suppose there is an element in GF 'e'. For a given generator 'g',\n      e = g^x. The multiplicative inverse of e is g^(255 - x). It turns\n      out that if use the inverse of a generator as another generator\n      it will produce all of the corresponding multiplicative inverses\n      at the same time. For this reason, we choose 5 as our inverse\n      generator because it only requires 2 multiplies and 1 add and its\n      inverse, 82, requires relatively few operations as well.\n\n      In order to apply the affine transformation, the multiplicative\n      inverse 'ei' of 'e' can be repeatedly XOR'd (4 times) with a\n      bit-cycling of 'ei'. To do this 'ei' is first stored in 's' and\n      'x'. Then 's' is left shifted and the high bit of 's' is made the\n      low bit. The resulting value is stored in 's'. Then 'x' is XOR'd\n      with 's' and stored in 'x'. On each subsequent iteration the same\n      operation is performed. When 4 iterations are complete, 'x' is\n      XOR'd with 'c' (0x63) and the transformed value is stored in 'x'.\n      For example:\n\n      s = 01000001\n      x = 01000001\n\n      iteration 1: s = 10000010, x ^= s\n      iteration 2: s = 00000101, x ^= s\n      iteration 3: s = 00001010, x ^= s\n      iteration 4: s = 00010100, x ^= s\n      x ^= 0x63\n\n      This can be done with a loop where s = (s << 1) | (s >> 7). However,\n      it can also be done by using a single 16-bit (in this case 32-bit)\n      number 'sx'. Since XOR is an associative operation, we can set 'sx'\n      to 'ei' and then XOR it with 'sx' left-shifted 1,2,3, and 4 times.\n      The most significant bits will flow into the high 8 bit positions\n      and be correctly XOR'd with one another. All that remains will be\n      to cycle the high 8 bits by XOR'ing them all with the lower 8 bits\n      afterwards.\n\n      At the same time we're populating sbox and isbox we can precompute\n      the multiplication we'll need to do to do MixColumns() later.\n    */\n\n    // apply affine transformation\n    sx = ei ^ (ei << 1) ^ (ei << 2) ^ (ei << 3) ^ (ei << 4);\n    sx = (sx >> 8) ^ (sx & 255) ^ 0x63;\n\n    // update tables\n    sbox[e] = sx;\n    isbox[sx] = e;\n\n    /* Mixing columns is done using matrix multiplication.

In total, we\n      get 4 equations:\n\n      r0,c' = 2*r0,c + 3*r1,c + 1*r2,c + 1*r3,c\n      r1,c' = 1*r0,c + 2*r1,c + 3*r2,c + 1*r3,c\n      r2,c' = 1*r0,c + 1*r1,c + 2*r2,c + 3*r3,c\n      r3,c' = 3*r0,c + 1*r1,c + 1*r2,c + 2*r3,c\n\n      As usual, the multiplication is as previously defined and the\n      addition is XOR. In order to optimize mixing columns we can store\n      the multiplication results in tables. If you think of the whole\n      column as a word (it might help to visualize by mentally rotating\n      the equations above by counterclockwise 90 degrees) then you can\n      see that it would be useful to map the multiplications performed on\n      each byte (r0, r1, r2, r3) onto a word as well. For instance, we\n      could map 2*r0,1*r0,1*r0,3*r0 onto a word by storing 2*r0 in the\n      highest 8 bits and 3*r0 in the lowest 8 bits (with the other two\n      respectively in the middle). This means that a table can be\n      constructed that uses r0 as an index to the word. We can do the\n      same with r1, r2, and r3, creating a total of 4 tables.\n\n      To construct a full c', we can just look up each byte of c in\n      their respective tables and XOR the results together.\n\n      Also, to build each table we only have to calculate the word\n      for 2,1,1,3 for every byte ... which we can do on each iteration\n      of this loop since we will iterate over every byte. After we have\n      calculated 2,1,1,3 we can get the results for the other tables\n      by cycling the byte at the end to the beginning. For instance\n      we can take the result of table 2,1,1,3 and produce table 3,2,1,1\n      by moving the right most byte to the left most position just like\n      how you can imagine the 3 moved out of 2,1,1,3 and to the front\n      to produce 3,2,1,1.\n\n      There is another optimization in that the same multiples of\n      the current element we need in order to advance our generator\n      to the next iteration can be reused in performing the 2,1,1,3\n      calculation. We also calculate the inverse mix column tables,\n      with e,9,d,b being the inverse of 2,1,1,3.\n\n      When we're done, and we need to actually mix columns, the first\n      byte of each state word should be put through mix[0] (2,1,1,3),\n      the second through mix[1] (3,2,1,1) and so forth. Then they should\n      be XOR'd together to produce the fully mixed column.\n    */\n\n    // calculate mix and imix table values\n    sx2 = xtime[sx];\n    e2 = xtime[e];\n    e4 = xtime[e2];\n    e8 = xtime[e4];\n    me =\n      (sx2 << 24) ^  // 2\n      (sx << 16) ^   // 1\n      (sx << 8) ^    // 1\n      (sx ^ sx2);    // 3\n    ime =\n      (e2 ^ e4 ^ e8) << 24 ^  // E (14)\n      (e ^ e8) << 16 ^        // 9\n      (e ^ e4 ^ e8) << 8 ^    // D (13)\n      (e ^ e2 ^ e8);          // B (11)\n    // produce each of the mix tables by rotating the 2,1,1,3 value\n    for(var n = 0; n < 4; ++n) {\n      mix[n][e] = me;\n      imix[n][sx] = ime;\n      // cycle the right most byte to the left most position\n      // ie: 2,1,1,3 becomes 3,2,1,1\n      me = me << 24 | me >>> 8;\n      ime = ime << 24 | ime >>> 8;\n    }\n\n    // get next element and inverse\n    if(e === 0) {\n      // 1 is the inverse of 1\n      e = ei = 1;\n    } else {\n      // e = 2e + 2*2*2*(10e)) = multiply e by 82 (chosen generator)\n      // ei = ei + 2*2*ei = multiply ei by 5 (inverse generator)\n      e = e2 ^ xtime[xtime[xtime[e2 ^ e8]]];\n      ei ^= xtime[xtime[ei]];\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n/**\n * Generates a key schedule using the AES key expansion algorithm.\n *\n * The AES algorithm takes the Cipher Key, K, and performs a Key Expansion\n * routine to generate a key schedule.

However, because there\n     are differences in the decryption algorithm, other than just swapping\n     in different look up tables, we must transform our key schedule to\n     account for these changes:\n\n     1. The decryption algorithm gets its key rounds in reverse order.\n     2. The decryption algorithm adds the round key before mixing columns\n       instead of afterwards.\n\n     We don't need to modify our key schedule to handle the first case,\n     we can just traverse the key schedule in reverse order when decrypting.\n\n     The second case requires a little work.\n\n     The tables we built for performing rounds will take an input and then\n     perform SubBytes() and MixColumns() or, for the decrypt version,\n     InvSubBytes() and InvMixColumns(). But the decrypt algorithm requires\n     us to AddRoundKey() before InvMixColumns(). This means we'll need to\n     apply some transformations to the round key to inverse-mix its columns\n     so they'll be correct for moving AddRoundKey() to after the state has\n     had its columns inverse-mixed.\n\n     To inverse-mix the columns of the state when we're decrypting we use a\n     lookup table that will apply InvSubBytes() and InvMixColumns() at the\n     same time. However, the round key's bytes are not inverse-substituted\n     in the decryption algorithm. To get around this problem, we can first\n     substitute the bytes in the round key so that when we apply the\n     transformation via the InvSubBytes()+InvMixColumns() table, it will\n     undo our substitution leaving us with the original value that we\n     want -- and then inverse-mix that value.\n\n     This change will correctly alter our key schedule so that we can XOR\n     each round key with our already transformed decryption state. This\n     allows us to use the same code path as the encryption algorithm.\n\n     We make one more change to the decryption key. Since the decryption\n     algorithm runs in reverse from the encryption algorithm, we reverse\n     the order of the round keys to avoid having to iterate over the key\n     schedule backwards when running the encryption algorithm later in\n     decryption mode. In addition to reversing the order of the round keys,\n     we also swap each round key's 2nd and 4th rows. See the comments\n     section where rounds are performed for more details about why this is\n     done.

The important distinction is\n      that the columns are cycling, with c0 being used with the m0\n      map when calculating c0, but c1 being used with the m0 map when\n      calculating c1 ... and so forth.\n\n      When performing the inverse we transform the mirror image and\n      skip the bottom row, instead of the top one, and move upwards:\n\n      c3 c2 c1 c0 => c0 c3 c2 c1  (cycled 3 bytes) *same as encryption\n      c3 c2 c1 c0    c1 c0 c3 c2  (cycled 2 bytes)\n      c3 c2 c1 c0    c2 c1 c0 c3  (cycled 1 byte)  *same as encryption\n      c3 c2 c1 c0    c3 c2 c1 c0\n\n      If you compare the resulting matrices for ShiftRows()+MixColumns()\n      and for InvShiftRows()+InvMixColumns() the 2nd and 4th columns are\n      different (in encrypt mode vs. decrypt mode). So in order to use\n      the same code to handle both encryption and decryption, we will\n      need to do some mapping.\n\n      If in encryption mode we let a=c0, b=c1, c=c2, d=c3, and r<N> be\n      a row number in the state, then the resulting matrix in encryption\n      mode for applying the above transformations would be:\n\n      r1: a b c d\n      r2: b c d a\n      r3: c d a b\n      r4: d a b c\n\n      If we did the same in decryption mode we would get:\n\n      r1: a d c b\n      r2: b a d c\n      r3: c b a d\n      r4: d c b a\n\n      If instead we swap d and b (set b=c3 and d=c1), then we get:\n\n      r1: a b c d\n      r2: d a b c\n      r3: c d a b\n      r4: b c d a\n\n      Now the 1st and 3rd rows are the same as the encryption matrix. All\n      we need to do then to make the mapping exactly the same is to swap\n      the 2nd and 4th rows when in decryption mode. To do this without\n      having to do it on each iteration, we swapped the 2nd and 4th rows\n      in the decryption key schedule. We also have to do the swap above\n      when we first pull in the input and when we set the final output. */\n    a2 =\n      m0[a >>> 24] ^\n      m1[b >>> 16 & 255] ^\n      m2[c >>> 8 & 255] ^\n      m3[d & 255] ^ w[++i];\n    b2 =\n      m0[b >>> 24] ^\n      m1[c >>> 16 & 255] ^\n      m2[d >>> 8 & 255] ^\n      m3[a & 255] ^ w[++i];\n    c2 =\n      m0[c >>> 24] ^\n      m1[d >>> 16 & 255] ^\n      m2[a >>> 8 & 255] ^\n      m3[b & 255] ^ w[++i];\n    d =\n      m0[d >>> 24] ^\n      m1[a >>> 16 & 255] ^\n      m2[b >>> 8 & 255] ^\n      m3[c & 255] ^ w[++i];\n    a = a2;\n    b = b2;\n    c = c2;\n  }\n\n  /*\n    Encrypt:\n    SubBytes(state)\n    ShiftRows(state)\n    AddRoundKey(state, w[Nr*Nb, (Nr+1)*Nb-1])\n\n    Decrypt:\n    InvShiftRows(state)\n    InvSubBytes(state)\n    AddRoundKey(state, w[0, Nb-1])\n   */\n  // Note: rows are shifted inline\n  output[0] =\n    (sub[a >>> 24] << 24) ^\n    (sub[b >>> 16 & 255] << 16) ^\n    (sub[c >>> 8 & 255] << 8) ^\n    (sub[d & 255]) ^ w[++i];\n  output[decrypt ? 3 : 1] =\n    (sub[b >>> 24] << 24) ^\n    (sub[c >>> 16 & 255] << 16) ^\n    (sub[d >>> 8 & 255] << 8) ^\n    (sub[a & 255]) ^ w[++i];\n  output[2] =\n    (sub[c >>> 24] << 24) ^\n    (sub[d >>> 16 & 255] << 16) ^\n    (sub[a >>> 8 & 255] << 8) ^\n    (sub[b & 255]) ^ w[++i];\n  output[decrypt ? 1 : 3] =\n    (sub[d >>> 24] << 24) ^\n    (sub[a >>> 16 & 255] << 16) ^\n    (sub[b >>> 8 & 255] << 8) ^\n    (sub[c & 255]) ^ w[++i];\n}\n\n/**\n * Deprecated.

eval("/**\n * Javascript implementation of Abstract Syntax Notation Number One.\n *\n * @author Dave Longley\n *\n * Copyright (c) 2010-2015 Digital Bazaar, Inc.\n *\n * An API for storing data using the Abstract Syntax Notation Number One\n * format using DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoding. This encoding is\n * commonly used to store data for PKI, i.e. X.509 Certificates, and this\n * implementation exists for that purpose.\n *\n * Abstract Syntax Notation Number One (ASN.1) is used to define the abstract\n * syntax of information without restricting the way the information is encoded\n * for transmission. It provides a standard that allows for open systems\n * communication. ASN.1 defines the syntax of information data and a number of\n * simple data types as well as a notation for describing them and specifying\n * values for them.\n *\n * The RSA algorithm creates public and private keys that are often stored in\n * X.509 or PKCS#X formats -- which use ASN.1 (encoded in DER format). This\n * class provides the most basic functionality required to store and load DSA\n * keys that are encoded according to ASN.1.\n *\n * The most common binary encodings for ASN.1 are BER (Basic Encoding Rules)\n * and DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules). DER is just a subset of BER that\n * has stricter requirements for how data must be encoded.\n *\n * Each ASN.1 structure has a tag (a byte identifying the ASN.1 structure type)\n * and a byte array for the value of this ASN1 structure which may be data or a\n * list of ASN.1 structures.\n *\n * Each ASN.1 structure using BER is (Tag-Length-Value):\n *\n * | byte 0 | bytes X | bytes Y |\n * |--------|---------|----------\n * |  tag   | length  |  value  |\n *\n * ASN.1 allows for tags to be of \"High-tag-number form\" which allows a tag to\n * be two or more octets, but that is not supported by this class. A tag is\n * only 1 byte. Bits 1-5 give the tag number (ie the data type within a\n * particular 'class'), 6 indicates whether or not the ASN.1 value is\n * constructed from other ASN.1 values, and bits 7 and 8 give the 'class'. If\n * bits 7 and 8 are both zero, the class is UNIVERSAL. If only bit 7 is set,\n * then the class is APPLICATION. If only bit 8 is set, then the class is\n * CONTEXT_SPECIFIC. If both bits 7 and 8 are set, then the class is PRIVATE.\n * The tag numbers for the data types for the class UNIVERSAL are listed below:\n *\n * UNIVERSAL 0 Reserved for use by the encoding rules\n * UNIVERSAL 1 Boolean type\n * UNIVERSAL 2 Integer type\n * UNIVERSAL 3 Bitstring type\n * UNIVERSAL 4 Octetstring type\n * UNIVERSAL 5 Null type\n * UNIVERSAL 6 Object identifier type\n * UNIVERSAL 7 Object descriptor type\n * UNIVERSAL 8 External type and Instance-of type\n * UNIVERSAL 9 Real type\n * UNIVERSAL 10 Enumerated type\n * UNIVERSAL 11 Embedded-pdv type\n * UNIVERSAL 12 UTF8String type\n * UNIVERSAL 13 Relative object identifier type\n * UNIVERSAL 14-15 Reserved for future editions\n * UNIVERSAL 16 Sequence and Sequence-of types\n * UNIVERSAL 17 Set and Set-of types\n * UNIVERSAL 18-22, 25-30 Character string types\n * UNIVERSAL 23-24 Time types\n *\n * The length of an ASN.1 structure is specified after the tag identifier.\n * There is a definite form and an indefinite form. The indefinite form may\n * be used if the encoding is constructed and not all immediately available.\n * The indefinite form is encoded using a length byte with only the 8th bit\n * set. The end of the constructed object is marked using end-of-contents\n * octets (two zero bytes).\n *\n * The definite form looks like this:\n *\n * The length may take up 1 or more bytes, it depends on the length of the\n * value of the ASN.1 structure. DER encoding requires that if the ASN.1\n * structure has a value that has a length greater than 127, more than 1 byte\n * will be used to store its length, otherwise just one byte will be used.\n * This is strict.\n *\n * In the case that the length of the ASN.1 value is less than 127, 1 octet\n * (byte) is used to store the \"short form\" length. The 8th bit has a value of\n * 0 indicating the length is \"short form\" and not \"long form\" and bits 7-1\n * give the length of the data. (The 8th bit is the left-most, most significant\n * bit: also known as big endian or network format).\n *\n * In the case that the length of the ASN.1 value is greater than 127, 2 to\n * 127 octets (bytes) are used to store the \"long form\" length. The first\n * byte's 8th bit is set to 1 to indicate the length is \"long form.\" Bits 7-1\n * give the number of additional octets. All following octets are in base 256\n * with the most significant digit first (typical big-endian binary unsigned\n * integer storage). So, for instance, if the length of a value was 257, the\n * first byte would be set to:\n *\n * 10000010 = 130 = 0x82.\n *\n * This indicates there are 2 octets (base 256) for the length. The second and\n * third bytes (the octets just mentioned) would store the length in base 256:\n *\n * octet 2: 00000001 = 1 * 256^1 = 256\n * octet 3: 00000001 = 1 * 256^0 = 1\n * total = 257\n *\n * The algorithm for converting a js integer value of 257 to base-256 is:\n *\n * var value = 257;\n * var bytes = [];\n * bytes[0] = (value >>> 8) & 0xFF; // most significant byte first\n * bytes[1] = value & 0xFF;        // least significant byte last\n *\n * On the ASN.1 UNIVERSAL Object Identifier (OID) type:\n *\n * An OID can be written like: \"value1.value2.value3...valueN\"\n *\n * The DER encoding rules:\n *\n * The first byte has the value 40 * value1 + value2.\n * The following bytes, if any, encode the remaining values. Each value is\n * encoded in base 128, most significant digit first (big endian), with as\n * few digits as possible, and the most significant bit of each byte set\n * to 1 except the last in each value's encoding. For example: Given the\n * OID \"1.2.840.113549\", its DER encoding is (remember each byte except the\n * last one in each encoding is OR'd with 0x80):\n *\n * byte 1: 40 * 1 + 2 = 42 = 0x2A.\n * bytes 2-3: 128 * 6 + 72 = 840 = 6 72 = 6 72 = 0x0648 = 0x8648\n * bytes 4-6: 16384 * 6 + 128 * 119 + 13 = 6 119 13 = 0x06770D = 0x86F70D\n *\n * The final value is: 0x2A864886F70D.\n * The full OID (including ASN.1 tag and length of 6 bytes) is:\n * 0x06062A864886F70D\n */\nvar forge = __webpack_require__(/*! ./forge */ \"(rsc)/./node_modules/node-forge/lib/forge.js\");\n__webpack_require__(/*! ./util */ \"(rsc)/./node_modules/node-forge/lib/util.js\");\n__webpack_require__(/*! ./oids */ \"(rsc)/./node_modules/node-forge/lib/oids.js\");\n\n/* ASN.1 API */\nvar asn1 = module.exports = forge.asn1 = forge.asn1 || {};\n\n/**\n * ASN.1 classes.\n */\nasn1.Class = {\n  UNIVERSAL:        0x00,\n  APPLICATION:      0x40,\n  CONTEXT_SPECIFIC: 0x80,\n  PRIVATE:          0xC0\n};\n\n/**\n * ASN.1 types.

This function performs Galois\n * field multiplication. The field, GF(2^128), is defined by the polynomial:\n *\n * x^128 + x^7 + x^2 + x + 1\n *\n * Which is represented in little-endian binary form as: 11100001 (0xe1). When\n * the value of a coefficient is 1, a bit is set. The value R, is the\n * concatenation of this value and 120 zero bits, yielding a 128-bit value\n * which matches the block size.\n *\n * This function will multiply two elements (vectors of bytes), X and Y, in\n * the field GF(2^128).

Suppose n1, n2, ..., nk are positive integers which are pairwise\n    coprime (n1 and n2 have no common factors other than 1). For any\n    integers x1, x2, ..., xk there exists an integer x solving the\n    system of simultaneous congruences (where ~= means modularly\n    congruent so a ~= b mod n means a mod n = b mod n):\n\n    x ~= x1 mod n1\n    x ~= x2 mod n2\n    ...\n    x ~= xk mod nk\n\n    This system of congruences has a single simultaneous solution x\n    between 0 and n - 1. Furthermore, each xk solution and x itself\n    is congruent modulo the product n = n1*n2*...*nk.\n    So x1 mod n = x2 mod n = xk mod n = x mod n.\n\n    The single simultaneous solution x can be solved with the following\n    equation:\n\n    x = sum(xi*ri*si) mod n where ri = n/ni and si = ri^-1 mod ni.\n\n    Where x is less than n, xi = x mod ni.\n\n    For RSA we are only concerned with k = 2. The modulus n = pq, where\n    p and q are coprime. The RSA decryption algorithm is:\n\n    y = x^d mod n\n\n    Given the above:\n\n    x1 = x^d mod p\n    r1 = n/p = q\n    s1 = q^-1 mod p\n    x2 = x^d mod q\n    r2 = n/q = p\n    s2 = p^-1 mod q\n\n    So y = (x1r1s1 + x2r2s2) mod n\n         = ((x^d mod p)q(q^-1 mod p) + (x^d mod q)p(p^-1 mod q)) mod n\n\n    According to Fermat's Little Theorem, if the modulus P is prime,\n    for any integer A not evenly divisible by P, A^(P-1) ~= 1 mod P.\n    Since A is not divisible by P it follows that if:\n    N ~= M mod (P - 1), then A^N mod P = A^M mod P. Therefore:\n\n    A^N mod P = A^(M mod (P - 1)) mod P. (The latter takes less effort\n    to calculate). In order to calculate x^d mod p more quickly the\n    exponent d mod (p - 1) is stored in the RSA private key (the same\n    is done for x^d mod q). These values are referred to as dP and dQ\n    respectively. Therefore we now have:\n\n    y = ((x^dP mod p)q(q^-1 mod p) + (x^dQ mod q)p(p^-1 mod q)) mod n\n\n    Since we'll be reducing x^dP by modulo p (same for q) we can also\n    reduce x by p (and q respectively) before hand. Therefore, let\n\n    xp = ((x mod p)^dP mod p), and\n    xq = ((x mod q)^dQ mod q), yielding:\n\n    y = (xp*q*(q^-1 mod p) + xq*p*(p^-1 mod q)) mod n\n\n    This can be further reduced to a simple algorithm that only\n    requires 1 inverse (the q inverse is used) to be used and stored.\n    The algorithm is called Garner's algorithm. If qInv is the\n    inverse of q, we simply calculate:\n\n    y = (qInv*(xp - xq) mod p) * q + xq\n\n    However, there are two further complications. First, we need to\n    ensure that xp > xq to prevent signed BigIntegers from being used\n    so we add p until this is true (since we will be mod'ing with\n    p anyway). Then, there is a known timing attack on algorithms\n    using the CRT. To mitigate this risk, \"cryptographic blinding\"\n    should be used. This requires simply generating a random number r\n    between 0 and n-1 and its inverse and multiplying x by r^e before\n    calculating y and then multiplying y by r^-1 afterwards. Note that\n    r must be coprime with n (gcd(r, n) === 1) in order to have an\n    inverse.\n  */\n\n  // cryptographic blinding\n  var r;\n  do {\n    r = new BigInteger(\n      forge.util.bytesToHex(forge.random.getBytes(key.n.bitLength() / 8)),\n      16);\n  } while(r.compareTo(key.n) >= 0 || !r.gcd(key.n).equals(BigInteger.ONE));\n  x = x.multiply(r.modPow(key.e, key.n)).mod(key.n);\n\n  // calculate xp and xq\n  var xp = x.mod(key.p).modPow(key.dP, key.p);\n  var xq = x.mod(key.q).modPow(key.dQ, key.q);\n\n  // xp must be larger than xq to avoid signed bit usage\n  while(xp.compareTo(xq) < 0) {\n    xp = xp.add(key.p);\n  }\n\n  // do last step\n  var y = xp.subtract(xq)\n    .multiply(key.qInv).mod(key.p)\n    .multiply(key.q).add(xq);\n\n  // remove effect of random for cryptographic blinding\n  y = y.multiply(r.modInverse(key.n)).mod(key.n);\n\n  return y;\n};\n\n/**\n * NOTE: THIS METHOD IS DEPRECATED, use 'sign' on a private key object or\n * 'encrypt' on a public key object instead.\n *\n * Performs RSA encryption.\n *\n * The parameter bt controls whether to put padding bytes before the\n * message passed in.

Therefore, the length of the message\n    plus the padding must be congruent to 448 mod 512 because\n    512 - 128 = 448.\n\n    In order to fill up the message length it must be filled with\n    padding that begins with 1 bit followed by all 0 bits. Padding\n    must *always* be present, so if the message length is already\n    congruent to 448 mod 512, then 512 padding bits must be added. */\n\n    var finalBlock = forge.util.createBuffer();\n

The length\n *   MUST NOT exceed 2^14 = 16384 bytes.\n *\n * fragment:\n *   The application data. This data is transparent and treated as an\n *   independent block to be dealt with by the higher-level protocol specified\n *   by the type field.\n *\n * Implementations MUST NOT send zero-length fragments of Handshake, Alert, or\n * ChangeCipherSpec content types.

Note that in versions of TLS prior to 1.1, there was no\n *   IV field, and the last ciphertext block of the previous record (the \"CBC\n *   residue\") was used as the IV. This was changed to prevent the attacks\n *   described in [CBCATT]. For block ciphers, the IV length is of length\n *   SecurityParameters.record_iv_length, which is equal to the\n *   SecurityParameters.block_size.\n *\n * padding:\n *   Padding that is added to force the length of the plaintext to be an\n *   integral multiple of the block cipher's block length. The padding MAY be\n *   any length up to 255 bytes, as long as it results in the\n *   TLSCiphertext.length being an integral multiple of the block length.\n *   Lengths longer than necessary might be desirable to frustrate attacks on\n *   a protocol that are based on analysis of the lengths of exchanged\n *   messages. Each uint8 in the padding data vector MUST be filled with the\n *   padding length value. The receiver MUST check this padding and MUST use\n *   the bad_record_mac alert to indicate padding errors.\n *\n * padding_length:\n *   The padding length MUST be such that the total size of the\n *   GenericBlockCipher structure is a multiple of the cipher's block length.\n *   Legal values range from zero to 255, inclusive. This length specifies the\n *   length of the padding field exclusive of the padding_length field itself.\n *\n * The encrypted data length (TLSCiphertext.length) is one more than the sum of\n * SecurityParameters.block_length, TLSCompressed.length,\n * SecurityParameters.mac_length, and padding_length.\n *\n * Example: If the block length is 8 bytes, the content length\n * (TLSCompressed.length) is 61 bytes, and the MAC length is 20 bytes, then the\n * length before padding is 82 bytes (this does not include the IV. Thus, the\n * padding length modulo 8 must be equal to 6 in order to make the total length\n * an even multiple of 8 bytes (the block length). The padding length can be\n * 6, 14, 22, and so on, through 254. If the padding length were the minimum\n * necessary, 6, the padding would be 6 bytes, each containing the value 6.\n * Thus, the last 8 octets of the GenericBlockCipher before block encryption\n * would be xx 06 06 06 06 06 06 06, where xx is the last octet of the MAC.\n *\n * Note: With block ciphers in CBC mode (Cipher Block Chaining), it is critical\n * that the entire plaintext of the record be known before any ciphertext is\n * transmitted. Otherwise, it is possible for the attacker to mount the attack\n * described in [CBCATT].\n *\n * Implementation note: Canvel et al. [CBCTIME] have demonstrated a timing\n * attack on CBC padding based on the time required to compute the MAC. In\n * order to defend against this attack, implementations MUST ensure that\n * record processing time is essentially the same whether or not the padding\n * is correct. In general, the best way to do this is to compute the MAC even\n * if the padding is incorrect, and only then reject the packet. For instance,\n * if the pad appears to be incorrect, the implementation might assume a\n * zero-length pad and then compute the MAC. This leaves a small timing\n * channel, since MAC performance depends, to some extent, on the size of the\n * data fragment, but it is not believed to be large enough to be exploitable,\n * due to the large block size of existing MACs and the small size of the\n * timing signal.\n */\nvar forge = __webpack_require__(/*! ./forge */ \"(rsc)/./node_modules/node-forge/lib/forge.js\");\n__webpack_require__(/*! ./asn1 */ \"(rsc)/./node_modules/node-forge/lib/asn1.js\");\n__webpack_require__(/*! ./hmac */ \"(rsc)/./node_modules/node-forge/lib/hmac.js\");\n__webpack_require__(/*! ./md5 */ \"(rsc)/./node_modules/node-forge/lib/md5.js\");\n__webpack_require__(/*! ./pem */ \"(rsc)/./node_modules/node-forge/lib/pem.js\");\n__webpack_require__(/*! ./pki */ \"(rsc)/./node_modules/node-forge/lib/pki.js\");\n__webpack_require__(/*! ./random */ \"(rsc)/./node_modules/node-forge/lib/random.js\");\n__webpack_require__(/*! ./sha1 */ \"(rsc)/./node_modules/node-forge/lib/sha1.js\");\n__webpack_require__(/*! ./util */ \"(rsc)/./node_modules/node-forge/lib/util.js\");\n\n/**\n * Generates pseudo random bytes by mixing the result of two hash functions,\n * MD5 and SHA-1.\n *\n * prf_TLS1(secret, label, seed) =\n *   P_MD5(S1, label + seed) XOR P_SHA-1(S2, label + seed);\n *\n * Each P_hash function functions as follows:\n *\n * P_hash(secret, seed) = HMAC_hash(secret, A(1) + seed) +\n *                        HMAC_hash(secret, A(2) + seed) +\n *                        HMAC_hash(secret, A(3) + seed) + ...\n * A() is defined as:\n *   A(0) = seed\n *   A(i) = HMAC_hash(secret, A(i-1))\n *\n * The '+' operator denotes concatenation.\n *\n * As many iterations A(N) as are needed are performed to generate enough\n * pseudo random byte output.

This does not make any assumptions about the\n * transport layer that TLS is working on top of, ie: it does not assume there\n * is a TCP/IP connection or establish one. A TLS connection is totally\n * abstracted away from the layer is runs on top of, it merely establishes a\n * secure channel between a client\" and a \"server\".\n *\n * A TLS connection contains 4 connection states: pending read and write, and\n * current read and write.\n *\n * At initialization, the current read and write states will be null. Only once\n * the security parameters have been set and the keys have been generated can\n * the pending states be converted into current states. Current states will be\n * updated for each record processed.\n *\n * A custom certificate verify callback may be provided to check information\n * like the common name on the server's certificate. It will be called for\n * every certificate in the chain. It has the following signature:\n *\n * variable func(c, certs, index, preVerify)\n * Where:\n * c         The TLS connection\n * verified  Set to true if certificate was verified, otherwise the alert\n *           tls.Alert.Description for why the certificate failed.\n * depth     The current index in the chain, where 0 is the server's cert.\n * certs     The certificate chain, *NOTE* if the server was anonymous then\n *           the chain will be empty.\n *\n * The function returns true on success and on failure either the appropriate\n * tls.Alert.Description or an object with 'alert' set to the appropriate\n * tls.Alert.Description and 'message' set to a custom error message. If true\n * is not returned then the connection will abort using, in order of\n * availability, first the returned alert description, second the preVerify\n * alert description, and lastly the default 'bad_certificate'.\n *\n * There are three callbacks that can be used to make use of client-side\n * certificates where each takes the TLS connection as the first parameter:\n *\n * getCertificate(conn, hint)\n *   The second parameter is a hint as to which certificate should be\n *   returned. If the connection entity is a client, then the hint will be\n *   the CertificateRequest message from the server that is part of the\n *   TLS protocol. If the connection entity is a server, then it will be\n *   the servername list provided via an SNI extension the ClientHello, if\n *   one was provided (empty array if not). The hint can be examined to\n *   determine which certificate to use (advanced). Most implementations\n *   will just return a certificate. The return value must be a\n *   PEM-formatted certificate or an array of PEM-formatted certificates\n *   that constitute a certificate chain, with the first in the array/chain\n *   being the client's certificate.\n * getPrivateKey(conn, certificate)\n *   The second parameter is an forge.pki X.509 certificate object that\n *   is associated with the requested private key. The return value must\n *   be a PEM-formatted private key.\n * getSignature(conn, bytes, callback)\n *   This callback can be used instead of getPrivateKey if the private key\n *   is not directly accessible in javascript or should not be. For\n *   instance, a secure external web service could provide the signature\n *   in exchange for appropriate credentials. The second parameter is a\n *   string of bytes to be signed that are part of the TLS protocol. These\n *   bytes are used to verify that the private key for the previously\n *   provided client-side certificate is accessible to the client. The\n *   callback is a function that takes 2 parameters, the TLS connection\n *   and the RSA encrypted (signed) bytes as a string. This callback must\n *   be called once the signature is ready.\n *\n * @param options the options for this connection:\n *   server: true if the connection is server-side, false for client.\n *   sessionId: a session ID to reuse, null for a new connection.\n *   caStore: an array of certificates to trust.\n *   sessionCache: a session cache to use.\n *   cipherSuites: an optional array of cipher suites to use,\n *     see tls.CipherSuites.\n *   connected: function(conn) called when the first handshake completes.\n *   virtualHost: the virtual server name to use in a TLS SNI extension.\n *   verifyClient: true to require a client certificate in server mode,\n *     'optional' to request one, false not to (default: false).\n *   verify: a handler used to custom verify certificates in the chain.\n *   verifyOptions: an object with options for the certificate chain validation.\n *     See documentation of pki.verifyCertificateChain for possible options.\n *     verifyOptions.verify is ignored. If you wish to specify a verify handler\n *     use the verify key.\n *   getCertificate: an optional callback used to get a certificate or\n *     a chain of certificates (as an array).\n *   getPrivateKey: an optional callback used to get a private key.\n *   getSignature: an optional callback used to get a signature.\n *   tlsDataReady: function(conn) called when TLS protocol data has been\n *     prepared and is ready to be used (typically sent over a socket\n *     connection to its destination), read from conn.tlsData buffer.\n *   dataReady: function(conn) called when application data has\n *     been parsed from a TLS record and should be consumed by the\n *     application, read from conn.data buffer.\n *   closed: function(conn) called when the connection has been closed.\n *   error: function(conn, error) called when there was an error.\n *   deflate: function(inBytes) if provided, will deflate TLS records using\n *     the deflate algorithm if the server supports it.\n *   inflate: function(inBytes) if provided, will inflate TLS records using\n *     the deflate algorithm if the server supports it.\n *\n * @return the new TLS connection.\n

This requires obtaining a sequence of\n    certificates that support that binding. That sequence should be provided\n    in the passed 'chain'. The trust anchor should be in the given CA\n    store. The 'end entity' certificate is the certificate provided by the\n    end point (typically a server) and is the first in the chain.\n\n    To meet this goal, the path validation process verifies, among other\n    things, that a prospective certification path (a sequence of n\n    certificates or a 'chain') satisfies the following conditions:\n\n    (a) for all x in {1, ..., n-1}, the subject of certificate x is\n          the issuer of certificate x+1;\n\n    (b) certificate 1 is issued by the trust anchor;\n\n    (c) certificate n is the certificate to be validated; and\n\n    (d) for all x in {1, ..., n}, the certificate was valid at the\n          time in question.\n\n    Note that here 'n' is index 0 in the chain and 1 is the last certificate\n    in the chain and it must be signed by a certificate in the connection's\n    CA store.\n\n    The path validation process also determines the set of certificate\n    policies that are valid for this path, based on the certificate policies\n    extension, policy mapping extension, policy constraints extension, and\n    inhibit any-policy extension.\n\n    Note: Policy mapping extension not supported (Not Required).\n\n    Note: If the certificate has an unsupported critical extension, then it\n    must be rejected.\n\n    Note: A certificate is self-issued if the DNs that appear in the subject\n    and issuer fields are identical and are not empty.\n\n    The path validation algorithm assumes the following seven inputs are\n    provided to the path processing logic.

Any policy is accepted).\n    (d) trust anchor information, describing a CA that serves as a trust\n          anchor for the certification path. The trust anchor information\n          includes:\n\n      (1)  the trusted issuer name,\n      (2)  the trusted public key algorithm,\n      (3)  the trusted public key, and\n      (4)  optionally, the trusted public key parameters associated\n             with the public key.\n\n      (Trust anchors are provided via certificates in the CA store).\n\n      The trust anchor information may be provided to the path processing\n      procedure in the form of a self-signed certificate.
